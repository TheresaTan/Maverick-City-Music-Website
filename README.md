# Maverick-City-Music-Website

This repository contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a website based on the Maverick City Music band. In this website, there are three different pages: Home, Store, and About. 
The About page includes a picture of the band along with a temporary fill in paragraphs for the band's purpose from Wikipedia. The header and footer of the page is the same throughout all the pages of the website and the links to their facebook, spotify, and youtube work and will bring you to the band's pages on each platform.
The Home page showcases fake tour dates for each band giving the illusion of also being able to see their latest album for the band. 
Within the store page you are able to add/remove items to your cart and "purchase" your items when you are done shopping. Images are based on the Maverick City Music band and their albums plus merchandise.

This website also uses Stripe for the online payment processing. When using the Stripe purchase payment please enter a fake email (ex: asd@asd.com), along with the Stripe testing card number, 4242 4242 4242 4242, and enter a date that is within the future (ex: 12/25), and a fake csv number (ex: 123).
